In the first infographic, I visualized how Lionel Messi performed throughout his career. It was not just about the design techniques but during the information gathering phase, I had an opportunity to learn about things I didn&#8217;t know. Messi used score with his hand, for example.

In the second infographic, I illustrated the development of Lumia phone in one single picture. I love the color of this design much more than the Messi one.

I unfortunately did not win any prize at all with these two pictures, anyway, both of them were just my attempts, it was not necessary to problematize.
