Recently, I was invited by a friend of mine, who works at Swiss Post Solution Vietnam, to deliver a training course on the topic of Machine Learning. Despite the fact that the training is very short, approximately 9 hours in total, but it does not prevent me from conveying essential concepts that who is interested in Machine Learning should know. During two training sessions, I&#8217;d introduced linear regressions, logistic regression, neural networks as well as clustering (k-means algorithm in specific). It was a pity that people couldn&#8217;t have chance to get their hands dirty on the implementation in order to see how those concepts can be easily implemented in Octave.

After all, what I really concern is not only how people evaluate my presentation but what I have learnt during the time period I had spent effort to prepare. It was also great to talk and have lunches with people at the company, including ones who have very mature experiences in the field.

I start to miss a very cozy atmosphere of the company.
