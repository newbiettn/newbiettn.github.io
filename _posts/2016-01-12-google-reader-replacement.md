Lately I am not feeling like I am using time wisely when it is quite often I can see myself wasting a huge amount of time on consuming a large amount of information, among which were mostly garbage. I have done several contemplations regarding to this matter to see how I would done to improve such situation. And I come up with an idea of building a hub of filtered news. It would be exactly the same as Google Reader, which is already shut down for a period of time, but the difference is that this hub will be self-hosted.

{% include image.html url="/images/tiny-tiny-rss.png" description="My Tiny Tiny RSS homepage" %}

At the moment there are some open source applications that can be alternatives to Google Reader, among them I think Tiny Tiny RSS would be a top candidate. TTS is lightweight, and easy-to-set-up. I have started to use it for a couple of hours, and I couldn&#8217;t say how satisfied I am.

It can be downloaded <a href="https://tt-rss.org/gitlab/fox/tt-rss/wikis/home" target="_blank">here</a>.
