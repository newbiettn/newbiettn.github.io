It has been many months since my last post. There are numerous reasons for my inactivity but essentially I feel like I do not want to blog as much as I did. Perhaps I am so overwhelmed with writing on a daily basis as a PhD student that I no longer feel the need to spend more time on writing something else.

Anyway I am trying to come back on this activity since I start to feel like time is slipping through my fingers and there is only writing that can help me to log down good things like interesting research experiments, life and work experiences so that whenever the feeling of nostalgia creeping into my head, I can open this blog to feel like I have something personal to read about.

Not sure what to write now but I am glad that I spend sometime today to update this page after a while. I guess I will try to publish something meaningful later because I have experienced a lot of interesting things in terms of research experience, machine learning knowledge, etc. for the last 9 months that worth the writing.

Stay tuned.
