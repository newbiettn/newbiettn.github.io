Recently, I have spent a couple of days to play with HTML5 canvas, a thing that I have desired to learn for years. Back in late 2012, I started to see many developers published their canvas visualisations. At that time it was very intriguing to me in the sense that it is browser-based and developed using javascript, a language that I&#8217;m kinda fond of. Unfortunately since I was totally occupied with both daily work and Master school preparation, I couldn&#8217;t have time to learn HTML5 canvas, although I was very much interested in.

One of different things that makes `<canvas>` interesting is we are able to imitate physical model. In this pen, I create infinite number of particles and put them on spiral movement. It reminds me of old equations about classical mechanics I learnt in the high school.
