Visualization never gets boring, especially when it comes to demonstrate your working processing in a time span.

In my case, I had been working on the project **ihotfood** for a couple of months, spanning from October  2014 till mid December 2014. At the end of the project, I demonstrated the team members&#8217; contributions to the project in the most intuitive way. That&#8217;s where the de facto open source **gource **comes to shine.

Git log can be used as the input to **gource**. Then, I customized by changing the avatars, adding subtitle and background music.
