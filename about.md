I am Ngoc Tran. Computer aficionado. Indie music lover. Part-time swimmer.

**OBJECTIVES**

Besides being enthusiastic about making web a rich and interactive environment, I am also intrigued by creating information systems for business intelligent, health care and education. In the future, I see myself working towards fulfilling these personal interests and social benefits.

**PROFESSIONAL LIFE**

I graduated with 1st ranking in CS major from <a title="International University" href="http://hcmiu.edu.vn/vn/" target="_blank">International University, Vietnam National University</a> in 2010. Since 2011, I have been working as a software engineer at <a title="InBusiness AS" href="http://inbusiness.no/" target="_blank">InBusiness AS</a>, where I developed several CMS and CRM in Coldfusion and PHP, web and mobile apps in Javascript frameworks, CSS3 and HTML5.

In Fall 2013, I was fortunately granted a scholarship that allows me to pursue Master degree in any Belgian university. I chose to study Master of Computer Science at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, a public university located in Brussels (Belgium). I have learnt so much knowledge during two years at the school. Even some of things I would never apply, I can see they have changed me forever in the way I observe and evaluate problems in the field.

In Fall 2015, I was granted **[NICTA scholarship](http://www.nicta.com)** to pursue Ph.D at Swinburne University of Technology (Melbourne, Australia). I now become part of Swinburne Software Innovation Lab in a new project where I will research a data mining model using extensive sets of clinical data, and build on top such model a Domain Specific Visual Language to support medial practitioners.

**Update 08/2016**: NICTA has been merged to **[CSIRO](http://www.csiro.au/)** under a new brand name **[Data61](http://www.data61.csiro.au/)**. I am proud of being a part of CSIRO.

**PERSONAL STUFFS**

My feelings are influenced by indie music. I am a big fan of <a title="Bon Iver" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bon_Iver">Bon Iver</a>. I am also looking for partners in a non-mainstream music site project.

I am also an amateur photographer. You can find some pictures in Flickr and Instagram.

Daily swimming makes me less introverted and get my body into shape. Thanks a bundle for that!


**WHY newbiettn?**

&#8216;newbiettn&#8217; is no more than a random choice of nickname I&#8217;ve made when in high school. Even so, it conveys a few meanings. Whereas &#8216;ttn&#8217; is an abbreviation of my full name, the term &#8216;newbie&#8217; is a slang word, referring to one that is new to something. It was me specifically, a newcomer of computer technology. Yet it&#8217;s not the end of story. There&#8217;s still an extending part of it, which I like much more than the literal meaning. Back in time, I was looking for a nickname that is capable of portraying me, not only in the present but also in many years to come. Then I thought of me somewhat as an curiosity junkie, who always seeks new things in the field, like a newcomer. That&#8217;s why I decided to use the term &#8216;newbie&#8217; as part of my forever nickname.

  <strong>THIS SITE</strong>
</p>

When I was a child, I never thought writing would be of my interest. I always got struck by assignments of writing in school. That&#8217;s why it was seemingly certain to see a version of me would never start to write something, even meaningless, in spare time in the future. But when I grow up, that version is never a part of me. I realise one of best things I&#8217;ve ever done in my life is writing, and I see how much I have learnt when writing becomes a salient trait of me.

This is the latest version of the site. I used <a title="Mura" href="http://www.getmura.com/" target="_blank">Mura</a> in the past, but now I&#8217;m with <a title="Get WordPress" href="http://wordpress.org/download/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>

**Updated in August 2016**: Wordpress is over, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) is too simple to be ignored.
